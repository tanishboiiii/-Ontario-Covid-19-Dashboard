# -Ontario-Covid-19-Dashboard
A work in progress Covid-19 Dashboard for the province of Ontario.

#### Project Structure
- The getframe module deals with fetching the required files and data by making requests to the Ontario Data Catelouge and downloading the respective CSV files.

- The Ontario Covid-19 Dashboard module deals with actually displaying the required data using streamlit on the actual website

#### Goals and Other Features I Hope to Implement
- Seperate getframe module into different files for each type of statistic, to create cleaner code base
- Stasistics for deaths, and recoveries
- Map with colour coding by region of lock down zone
- Sidebar with all the different regions in Ontario, with each region having further information about statistics
- Data resources page
- About me page
